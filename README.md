Java-The_Game_of_Stones
=======================

The Game of Stones: The game begins with a pile of stones. The more players, the bigger the pile. The person who takes the last stone loses.

This game is an adaptation to the simple game we built in 1180 class. It includes objects, more than one player, player naming, and dynamic piles of rocks.
